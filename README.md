# 🧠 Quantum Sacred Tokenizer System

>A tokenizer? Nah. This is a **sacred-symbol-fueled, quantum-entangled, resonance-aligned concept synthesizer**. Part of the SAAAM system architecture, this tokenizer operates on multi-dimensional symbolic fields, not just plain text.

This repo includes everything needed to run the **Quantum Sacred Tokenizer** in standalone mode, with full reporting on vector alignment, resonance fields, latent embedding generation, and symbolic scoring.

---

## ⚙️ Running the Tokenizer (Standalone Mode)

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* `numpy`, `tqdm`, `json`, `os`, `math`
* No GPU required for tokenizer-only mode

### 🔥 Run It:

```bash
python main.py
```

> ⚠️ NOTE: The full model weights for the `QuantumIntelligencePartner` are not loaded in this mode. The system defaults to **tokenizer-only mode**, and informs you if weights are missing.

## 🔮 What Makes This Tokenizer Special?

This ain't no BPE. Here's what this **Quantum Sacred Tokenizer** does:

* ⚛️ **Quantum Entanglement Mapping**

  * Links token pairs based on conceptual resonance
  * Reinforces meaning structure across context

* 📐 **Sacred Geometry Alignment**

  * Embeddings aligned with 𝜙 (phi), Fibonacci, Solfeggio tones, and Platonic symmetry

* 🧮 **11D Latent Embedding Vectors**

  * Each token gets a fully structured concept vector across 11 hidden fields:

    * Structural Encoding
    * Semantic Field
    * Resonance Weight
    * Contextual Memory Bias
    * Quantum Linkage
    * Golden Ratio Proximity
    * and more...

* 🔁 **Recursive Refinement**

  * Token vectors evolve through usage
  * Reinforcement patterns strengthen entanglement over time

* 📊 **Scoring Metrics**

  * `quantum_resonance`
  * `frequency_resonance`
  * `phi_harmonic`
  * `fibonacci_alignment`
  * `sacred_field_alignment`

## 📤 Example Output

When you run `main.py`, you get:

```
[ Quantum Sacred Tokenizer ]
Initializing tokenizer...
Loading vocabulary from qnb_tokenizer.json

Entanglement map built. (243 strong pairings)

--- LATENT VECTORS ---
Token: "quantum"
Vector: [0.82, 0.76, ..., 0.91] (11D)

Resonance Score: 0.924
Fibonacci Alignment: ✔️
Sacred Field Alignment: ✔️
...
```

Each token is evaluated, vectorized, scored, and logged.

## 🧠 Future: `QuantumIntelligencePartner`

This repo is designed to work **with a full model backend**:

```py
from quantum_intelligence import QuantumIntelligencePartner
model = QuantumIntelligencePartner(weights_path)
response = model.infer(concept_vector)
```

Once you place your model weights at:

```
model_weights/consolidated.00.pth
```

…the system will auto-activate the full model.

---

## 🧪 Dev Tips

* 🧬 You can tweak sacred vector influence weights in `quantum_tokenizer.py`
* 🔁 Re-run `main.py` after updating `tokenizer.model` to regenerate scores
* 📡 You can plug into the FastAPI server via `api.py` and query it from `client.py`

## 🐍 API Usage (Optional)

Run the server:

```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

Then POST to:

```
http://localhost:8000/tokenize
```

With payload:

```json
{
  "text": "entangled harmonic vectors align"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "vectors": [...],
  "resonance": 0.897,
  "sacred_alignment": true,
  "tokens": ["entangled", "harmonic", ...]
}
```
